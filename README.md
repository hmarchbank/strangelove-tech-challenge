# Tech Challenge for Strangelove

I was required to build a pokedex that featured a list of 20 pokemon taken from PokeAPI in grid view. From here you should be able to click on a pokemon to receive more details about their statistics and traits.

To do this project I used create-react-app, axios and react-router-dom. The latter two need be installed in order for the app to run ($npm install axios react-router-dom) 

If you would like to see a deployed version of the app it is available here:
